# Run on Linux

If you have successfully installed Bastion, you will have a `bastion.sh` script that makes it easy to run Bastion without any hassle, among other things.

To start Bastion, first of all, you will need to navigate into the `Bastion` directory. _That is where the script is!_

```bash
cd ~/Bastion
```

Then, it is as simple as running this:

```bash
./bastion.sh --start
```

The `bastion.sh` script can do a whole lot of other things besides just helping you with running Bastion. Want to find out what else can it do? Simply, run `./bastion.sh` to find out.
{% endhint %}
