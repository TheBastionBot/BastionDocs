# Update on Windows

To update Bastion, first of all, you will need to navigate into the `Bastion` directory. _That is where the script is!_

Then, it is as simple as running running the `bastion.cmd` script by double-clicking (or single-clicking, based on your settings) it and following the on-screen prompt.

Wait for a few moments, so that it can update Bastion and its dependencies that you need to run Bastion smoothly. Meanwhile, you can go grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if you prefer that).

Once it is done, it will let you know.

Now, you can start Bastion, as usual, simply by running the `bastion.cmd` script and following the onscreen prompt.
