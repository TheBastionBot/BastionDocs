# Update on Docker

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Legacy Guide**

Docker image has not yet been updated for **Bastion v10.** So, this guide won't work for you. We'll update it as soon as possible.
{% endhint %}

Simply shut down Bastion, stop the container and pull the Docker image again to download the updated version. Use the same run command to start bastion.&#x20;

When bastion comes online, it should be on the new version
