# Introduction

Here you’ll find documentation on how to install, set up, run and update Bastion, so that you can empower your Discord server and have an awesome bot for your communities.

All of our [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/TheBastionBot/bastion-docs) and we would ❤ corrections and improvements!



Come hang out in our [headquarters ](https://discord.gg/fzx8fkt)if you wanna chat with other users, as well as the devs, and see what’s being cranked out.
